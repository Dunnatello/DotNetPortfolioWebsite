# Dunnatello's Portfolio
## Description
This was originally my portfolio website located [here](https://dunnatello.com/). However, I have transitioned to a pure HTML/CSS approach for the final implementation as mentioned in the `Lessons Learned` section. 

I created this website project to improve my web development skills and display my projects in a unique way.  

Feel free to check out how I implemented my portfolio website!

## Lessons Learned
While working on this project, I learned about how ASP.NET Core websites function and developed my own website using the framework. Additionally, I learned how to use the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform to host the website.

### ASP.NET Core Benefits
After completing this project and redesigning the result in HTML/CSS, I realized how much work that ASP.NET Core does in the background to make web development easier. Elements like navigation bars and footers are contained in separate files to prevent repeated code on pages and file paths are easier to maintain.

### Bad Idea: ASP.NET for A Portfolio Website
However, there were some issues that I ran into while developing this project. Since the website uses programming languages such as JavaScript and C#, the website was no longer static and was subject to server costs on the Azure platform. After accumulating $6.96 in server costs over three days, I realized that I would need to rethink my implementation.  

Therefore, I decided to take my work here and remove the ASP.NET Core framework entirely to create a new portfolio website using pure HTML/CSS.  

The new HTML/CSS version is functionally the same as this ASP.NET Core version (minus the interactive Bootstrap hamburger menu on mobile layouts), but it is purely static with no programming languages needed. That way, I can continue to host my portfolio website in the future without needing to pay unnecessary server costs. 

## Conclusion
Although I only used this version temporarily, I gained valuable experience from creating an ASP.NET Core website and I will be able to use these skills in future endeavors.

## Technical Details
This website uses ASP.NET Core 7.0 and was made using HTML/CSS/C#. It was hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.
